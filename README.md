# Tracker Keeper

Tracker Keeper is a goal management tool written in AngularJS. It's a single page application that I'm currently hosting on my portfolio site at [http://jefdewitt.com/trackerkeeper/](http://jefdewitt.com/trackerkeeper/#/). Since this AngularJS app was built on a Jekyll framework there are some idiosyncrasies to it, which I'll point out below.

I created Tracker Keeper as a means to chart my progress toward specific goals, goals measured in time. Tracker Keeper makes it easy to track the time you spend toward achieving these goals, and uses simple algebra to document the headway your making to keep you motivated. 

# Requirements

- AngularJS 1.2.13+
- angular-route
- angular-animate
- ngStorage

# Installation

Go to [https://angularjs.org/](https://angularjs.org/) to get a fresh AngularJS download or use `NPM`. It's a best practice to use the same versions when available. So, if you're using AngularJS 1.2.13, try using ng modules that are version 1.2.13. The syntax for that is `npm install <module-name>@1.2.13`, for example.

### NPM

```bash
npm install angular
```

```bash
npm install angular-route
```

```bash
npm install angular-animate
```

```bash
npm install ngstorage
```
